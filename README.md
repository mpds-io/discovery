DISCOVERY is the design tool for searching the hidden correlations between the inorganic substance properties (_e.g._ *structure prototype* or *enthalpy of formation*) and the atomic property parameters of the constituent chemical elements (_e.g._ *atomic number* or *electronegativity*). This is the Windows-only program written in the Microsoft Foundation Classes (Visual C++). All Windows versions are supported.

The program consists of two parts: the user interface and the calculation program **QSD**, which performs the actual analysis of the data. The user interface manages the results of **QSD** and displays them. This part of the program was developed by Dr. Brandenburg. Its source codes are available in this repository. The program **QSD** was developed by Dr. Michael Berndt. Its source codes have been unfortunately lost.
